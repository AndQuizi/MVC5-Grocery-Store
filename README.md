# MVC5-Grocery-Store
- Simple project to brush up on my ASP.NET MVC5 skills and learn some new concepts.
- I created an ASP Web Forms project in the past, which is basically has the models of MVC, but no VC.
- Since I only had expierence with Web Forms, I wanted to properly learn MVC5

# Things I was seeking  to learn, and did so
- Pretty much every related to Entity Framwork (EF)
- Code First with EF
- Database first with EF
- Database Migrations
- Razor syntax
- Brush up on MVC concepts
- Brush up on ASP.NET sessions and account management
- Be competent enough with MVC5 to put it on my resume

# Things I didn't bother with
- CSS
  - I am quite competent with CSS, especially with bootstrap, so I didn't bother using it much here
- A good UX 
  - I am here just to learn MVC5 concepts enough so that I can put it on my resume
- A working checkout
  - This porject isn't going to get hosted, so I never ended up finishing the checkout function. By this point I felt confident in my MVC5 skills and wanted to move on to another project.
